            <p>This lockbox is strong.  We build our product using special material from the aerospace industry called hex core.  This make the lockbox very strong and light.</p>
            <p>Though this box is strong, it does not need to be to protect packages.  Package theft is a crime of opportunity.  If your package is hidden and modestly protected, thieves will look for an easier target.</p>
            <p>Maintaining the product light is key in keeping costs to consumers low and making the product easy to manage.  Donâ€™t worry though, every lockbox comes with a chain down port to prevent anyone from walking away with it.</p>

          <p>This product is not a typical lockbox, it is a package receiving system.  Just like companies maintain shipping and receiving department to manage, maintain, and track their deliveries, with the exponential increase in packages being delivered to the home,  people need something similar.</p>
          <p>Weather can destroy sensitive packages. Our system will monitor and learn what weather forecasts mean for your packages.  If you have sensitive packages coming, we will notify you of extreme weather before it arrives.  This is a must have for anyone who gets medication, food, electronics, or any other sensitive items delivered to their home. </p>
          <p>Our system uses advanced AI to learn from Shipmate network data, weather data, security data, and lockbox data, to lear what it all means for the safety, security and timely delivery of your packages</p>
          <p>Security is a top concern for deliveries.  Tens of millions of dollars worth of packages are stolen everyday.  We monitor public records and Shipmate network data to understand your neighborhoods security so you can take precautionary measures. </p>
          <p>Current package tracking is unreliable.  Our system will use all available data to learn when you can actually expect to receive your packages, not just when they are scheduled to arrive. </p>
